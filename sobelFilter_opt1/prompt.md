## Prompt to optimize HLS C++ design

rockyco: You are an expert on HLS C++ design. Try to optimize this sobel filter design to reduce memory usage. Only two local memory with depth of `WIDTH` are allowed.

GitHub Copilot: Here's how to optimize the Sobel filter design to reduce memory usage, focusing on using only two local memory buffers with a depth of `WIDTH`.

**1. Overall Strategy:**

The core idea is to process the image row by row, keeping only the current row and the previous row in memory.  This eliminates the need for the large `image_data` array.  We'll calculate Gx and Gy incrementally as we process each pixel, further reducing memory.

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Eliminate `image_data`:**  Instead of storing the entire image, read pixels directly from `inputImage` as needed.
*   **Use line buffers:** Create two line buffers (`lineBuffer1`, `lineBuffer2`) to store the current and previous rows.
*   **Row-by-row processing:** Iterate through the image rows. For each row, read the necessary pixels from `inputImage`, update the line buffers, and calculate Gx, Gy, and the output.
*   **Circular buffer:** Use a circular buffer approach to alternate between the two line buffers, minimizing data movement.

## Create test picture

rockyco: Write Python code to read a *.png image, convert it into a grayscale image with adjustable resolution, and then print the values of its pixel data to a TXT file as stimulus input.

GitHub Copilot: Here's how to achieve the image processing and data extraction:

1.  **Resize the image:** Use the `PIL` library to resize the image to the desired resolution.
2.  **Convert to grayscale:** Convert the resized image to grayscale.
3.  **Extract pixel data:** Extract the pixel data from the grayscale image.
4.  **Write to a TXT file:** Write the pixel data to a TXT file, formatted as stimulus input.

Here's the code:

### [picConvert.py](file:///d%3A/Projects/MatlabProj/OpenWLAN/ImageProcessing/sobelFilter/_opt1/picConvert.py)

```python
from PIL import Image

def process_image(image_path, output_path, resolution=(64, 64)):
    """
    Reads a PNG image, converts it to grayscale with adjustable resolution,
    and prints the pixel data to a TXT file as stimulus input.

    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the input PNG image.
        output_path (str): Path to the output TXT file.
        resolution (tuple): Desired resolution (width, height) of the output image.
    """
    try:
        # Open the image
        img = Image.open(image_path)

        # Resize the image
        img = img.resize(resolution)

        # Convert to grayscale
        img = img.convert('L')

        # Get pixel data
        pixel_data = list(img.getdata())

        # Write pixel data to TXT file
        with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
            for pixel_value in pixel_data:
                f.write(str(pixel_value) + '\n')

        print(f"Image processed and saved to {output_path}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Image file not found at {image_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage:
    image_path = 'input.png'  # Replace with your image path
    output_path = 'stimulus.txt'  # Replace with your desired output path
    resolution = (64, 64)  # Replace with your desired resolution

    process_image(image_path, output_path, resolution)
```

## Generate testbech

You are an expert Vitis HLS C++ programmer and proficient in designing efficient FPGA architectures.
Revise the HLS C++ testbench file designed for verifying the function in the *.cpp file. Read the stimulus data from the *_in.txt file and generate the golden reference results. Then, compare the module's output data with the reference data using buffer data comparison, while maintaining an err_cnt variable to record the number of mismatches. Write the module's output data to the *_out.txt file.
